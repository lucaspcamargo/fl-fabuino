# FABUINO Project Files + Presentation Materials

The FABUINO is a simple arduino clone that is meant to be assembled by hand, during a workshop. It relies on an FTDI cable for programming.

This repo contains the project files and materials for presentation. The first instance of this workshop was given at FabLab Joinville in March 2020.
It was a good opportunity to project the spirit of DIY-electronics on the participants.

If anyone wants to use this for something just hit me up :)
